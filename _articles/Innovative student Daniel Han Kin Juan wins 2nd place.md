  - "Daniel’s innovative product, ‘Master Han Belly Good Crispy Pork Belly’, is a ready-meal product which allows home cooks to recreate restaurant quality pork belly with crackling in just 15 minutes. Daniel developed his love of cooking during his service in the Singapore Army, going on to complete a culinary cooking qualification and work as a chef. He has come to Adelaide to expand his food production knowledge and believes his product has real market potential. He anticipates that the ‘Master Han Belly Good Crispy Pork Belly’ will eventually appear on supermarket shelves."
  - "Before coming to Adelaide to do a Bachelor of Business (Food Entrepreneurship) Daniel worked as a chef in Singapore for six years. Once he arrived in Adelaide, he used his industry connections to develop a series of products with Olga’s Fine Foods called The Sauce Boss after industry research revealed a growing interest in Singaporean crab sauce in the Australian market. Daniel has since excelled in his Food Entrepreneurship studies achieving two credits, four distinctions and one high distinction in his first semester. He also organises potluck dinners with fellow international students, in an effort to share different cultures and food among his peers."
  - "The Governor of South Australia, His Excellency the Honourable Hieu Van Le AC, presented the International Student 2017 awards to winners in eleven categories. Students from 14 countries including China, India, Malaysia, Vietnam, Jordan, Mauritius and France were recognised for their outstanding achievements."
